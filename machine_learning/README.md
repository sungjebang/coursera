#MACHINE LEARNING
This file contains all of my assignments done for Coursera's "Machine Learning" course offered by Stanford University.

All assignments are done in Matlab.
##ASSIGNMENT 1
This assignment primarily focuses on linear regression and how it affects given data. I was given a template and I had to complete the code on the files to have the program running properly.
##ASSIGNMENT 2
This assignment focuses on logistic regression and how it affects different types of data. Similarly to assignment 1, I was given a template to work with and was tasked to complete the unfinished program.
